1. Uncaught Exception: AutoExecute Query 'swusers'
    - This is an error with MySQL and not Kayako.
    - Most are related to the swusers column which could indicate that this particular table is corrupted, full or improperly indexed.
    - Re-indexing the table or running a full repair scan could fix this issue.
    - Table may have crashed because buffer reached its limit.

    - Steps to mitigate (run these commands): 
        a. service httpd stop
        b. service mysqld stop
        c. myisamchk -s /var/lib/mysql/*/*/.MYI  (This will show tables that are broken)
        
        To increase buffer size: 
        d. myisamchk -r -q /var/lib/mysql/kayako_fusion/swsearchindex.MYI --sort_buffer_size=3G
        
        When done start the service back up:
        e. service mysqld start
        f. service httpd start
